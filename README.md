# Moving on from WebView to PWA 

Now that I have https://recipes.saathoff.us working as a Progressive Web App there isn't really a need for this app.

Due to that, I will be archiving the Reop.

~~This is based off a template project for Android Studio that allows you to create an android webview application in minutes.~~

~~Which has been changed to create an android webview app for https://recipes.saathoff.us.~~

~~If you are looking for the APK have a look at the [release page](https://github.com/cjthedj97/chowdown-webapp/releases).~~
